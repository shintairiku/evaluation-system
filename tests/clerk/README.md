# Clerk Integration Test

Simple test to verify your Clerk keys are working and ready for integration.

## Test File

### `simple-test.py` ‚≠ê **MAIN TEST**
Python script that checks if your Clerk keys are properly configured.

**Tests:**
- ‚úÖ Environment variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, CLERK_SECRET_KEY)
- ‚úÖ Key format validation (pk_*, sk_*)

## How to Run

```bash
# From project root directory
python3 tests/clerk/simple-test.py
```

## Test Results Interpretation

### ‚úÖ PASS - Test succeeded
- All functionality is working correctly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARN - Warning (not critical)
- Feature may not be fully configured but not blocking
- Often indicates missing optional configuration

### ‚ùå FAIL - Test failed
- Critical functionality is not working
- Requires immediate attention

### üî• ERROR - Exception occurred
- Unexpected error during test execution
- May indicate code or configuration issues

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Clerk JavaScript SDK is not loaded"
**Solution:** Make sure you're running the test within a Next.js application that has Clerk properly configured.

### "Clerk publishable key is missing or invalid"
**Solution:** 
1. Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
2. Verify the key starts with `pk_`
3. Restart your development server after adding environment variables

### "Backend connection test failed"
**Solution:**
1. Ensure your FastAPI backend is running
2. Check that the backend auth endpoints are implemented
3. Verify CORS settings allow frontend requests

## Integration Status

Based on the codebase analysis:

### ‚úÖ Frontend Integration (Complete)
- Clerk Next.js SDK installed
- Authentication pages created (`/sign-in`, `/sign-up`)
- Middleware configured (currently disabled)
- Environment variables configured
- Japanese localization enabled

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend Integration (Partial)
- Auth endpoints exist but contain placeholder code
- Webhook handlers exist but need implementation
- JWT verification not implemented
- Missing Clerk Python SDK dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Enable Authentication Middleware:**
   - Uncomment the authentication middleware in `frontend/src/middleware.ts`

2. **Complete Backend Integration:**
   - Add Clerk Python SDK to `backend/requirements.txt`
   - Implement JWT verification in `backend/app/api/v1/auth.py`
   - Complete webhook handlers in `backend/app/api/v1/webhooks.py`

3. **Add Environment Variables:**
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in `.env.local`
   - Set `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` for backend verification

4. **Test End-to-End Flow:**
   - Run these tests to verify frontend integration
   - Test actual sign-in/sign-up process
   - Verify backend API authentication

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the [Clerk Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs)
2. Review the GitHub issue #6 for setup instructions
3. Ensure all environment variables are properly configured
4. Verify both frontend and backend services are running
