# Domain Model: Self-Assessment Feature

**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** 2024-12-18
**Related Issues:** #414

---

## 1. Business Context

### Problem Statement
Employees need a structured way to evaluate their own performance against approved goals and competencies before supervisor review. The self-assessment process allows employees to:
- Reflect on their achievements during the evaluation period
- Rate their own performance using the company's grading system: **SS, S, A+, A, A-, B, C, D**
- Provide narrative comments for each goal and competency
- Submit their evaluation for supervisor review

**Assessment Scope:**
1. **業績目標 (Performance Goals)**: Created by employee → Approved by supervisor → Self-assessed by employee → Supervisor reviews self-assessment
2. **コンピテンシー (Competency Goals)**: Created by employee → Approved by supervisor → Self-assessed by employee → Supervisor reviews self-assessment
3. **コアバリュー (Core Value Goals)**: **Only available in end-of-period evaluations (期末). When available, unlocks AFTER supervisor approves self-assessments for Performance and Competency goals**

**Sequential Flow:**
```
Employee creates Performance + Competency goals
         ↓
Supervisor reviews and approves goals
         ↓
Employee completes self-assessments (Performance + Competency)
         ↓
Supervisor reviews and approves self-assessments
         ↓
Core Value goals become available (期末評価 only)
         ↓
Employee completes Core Value self-assessment
         ↓
Supervisor reviews and approves Core Value self-assessment
```

### Business Value
- **Employee Empowerment**: Employees have a voice in their performance evaluation
- **Better Communication**: Facilitates dialogue between employees and supervisors
- **Fair Process**: Ensures employees can present their perspective before final review
- **Documentation**: Creates a historical record of self-perception vs. supervisor assessment

### Target Users
1. **Employees**: Create and submit self-assessments for their approved goals
2. **Supervisors**: Review employee self-assessments alongside their own evaluations
3. **Admins**: Monitor self-assessment completion rates and compliance

### UI Implementation
- **Employee Self-Assessment Pages**: Located in `/evaluation-input` section
  - Employee creates and submits self-assessments
  - Draft auto-save functionality
  - Letter grade selection (SS, S, A+, A, A-, B, C, D)
  - Comment input for each goal
  - **Badge notification**: Shows count of rejected self-assessments requiring attention

- **Supervisor Review Pages**: Located in `/evaluation-feedback` section
  - Supervisor reviews submitted self-assessments
  - Provides supervisor rating and feedback
  - Approves or rejects employee self-assessments
  - Controls Core Value phase unlock
  - **Badge notification**: Shows count of pending self-assessments to review

### Notification System (Badge Counters)
Following the same pattern as goal-review:
- **When employee submits self-assessment**:
  - Badge counter appears on `/evaluation-feedback` navigation icon (left sidebar)
  - Supervisor sees count of pending self-assessments requiring review

- **When supervisor rejects self-assessment**:
  - Badge counter appears on `/evaluation-input` navigation icon (left sidebar)
  - Employee sees count of rejected self-assessments requiring revision

- **Badge behavior**:
  - Counter increments for each new submitted/rejected item
  - Counter decrements when supervisor approves or employee resubmits
  - Real-time updates via existing notification system

#### Technical Implementation (Following Goal Review Pattern)

**Architecture**: React Context API for state management

**Context Providers** (to be implemented):
- `SelfAssessmentReviewContext` - For supervisor side (pending self-assessments count)
  - Extends pattern from `GoalReviewContext`
  - Query: Count of `self_assessments` with `status = 'submitted'` (awaiting supervisor review)
  - API: Use existing `getSelfAssessmentsAction()` with filter

- `SelfAssessmentListContext` - For employee side (rejected self-assessments count)
  - Extends pattern from `GoalListContext`
  - Query: Count of `self_assessments` with `status = 'draft'` AND `previous_self_assessment_id IS NOT NULL`
  - API: Use existing `getSelfAssessmentsAction()` with filter

**Badge Display**:
- Location: `Sidebar` component (left navigation bar)
- Visual: Red badge with counter (max display: 99+)
- States:
  - Collapsed sidebar: Badge on icon only
  - Expanded sidebar: Badge next to label text
  - Hover: Transition effect

**Update Triggers**:
- Initial load: Auto-fetch on context provider mount
- Manual refresh: Page components call `refreshCount()` on data changes
- Cache: 5-minute cache + `revalidateTag()` on mutations

**Reference Implementation**:
- Pattern: `frontend/src/context/GoalReviewContext.tsx`
- Alternative: `frontend/src/context/GoalListContext.tsx` (with client-side filtering)
- Display: `frontend/src/components/display/sidebar.tsx` (lines 120-153)

## 2. Core Entities

### 2.1. SelfAssessment

**Purpose**: Represents an employee's self-evaluation of a specific goal (any category: Performance, Competency, or Core Value).

**Key Attributes**:
- `id` (UUID) - Unique identifier
- `goal_id` (UUID) - Reference to the goal being assessed
- `period_id` (UUID) - Reference to the evaluation period
- **`previous_self_assessment_id`** (UUID, nullable) - Reference to previous self-assessment (for rejection history tracking)
- **`self_rating_code`** (Enum) - Employee's grade: **SS | S | A+ | A | A- | B | C | D** (optional in draft, **required** for submission)
- `self_rating` (Decimal) - Numeric equivalent for calculations (internal, derived from rating_code)
- **`self_comment`** (String) - Employee's narrative self-assessment (optional in draft, **required** for submission)
- `status` (Enum) - Current state: `draft`, `submitted`, `approved`, or `rejected`
- `submitted_at` (DateTime) - Timestamp when assessment was submitted
- `created_at` (DateTime) - Record creation timestamp

- One SelfAssessment → One SupervisorFeedback (1:1, optional)
- One SelfAssessment → One Previous SelfAssessment (self-referential, optional, for rejection history)
- One User → Many Goals (1:N)
- One User → Many SelfAssessments (1:N)
- One EvaluationPeriod → Many Goals (1:N)
- One EvaluationPeriod → Many SelfAssessments (1:N)

## 4. Business Rules

### 4.1. Creation Rules

**Goal Prerequisites**:
- ✅ Self-assessment is **automatically created** when goal status changes to **approved**
- ✅ Goal must belong to the current user (employee)
- ✅ Goal's evaluation period must be active
- ✅ **One self-assessment per goal** (unique constraint on `goal_id`)
- ✅ System creates self-assessment in `draft` status with empty `self_rating_code` and `self_comment`

**Goal Category Sequential Rules**:
- ✅ **Performance Goals** (`業績目標`): Can be self-assessed immediately after approval
- ✅ **Competency Goals** (`コンピテンシー`): Can be self-assessed immediately after approval
- ✅ **Core Value Goals** (`コアバリュー`):
  - **Only available in end-of-period evaluations (期末評価)**
  - Not available in mid-year or interim reviews
  - Can ONLY be self-assessed **after supervisor has approved** self-assessments for ALL Performance and Competency goals in the same period

**Period Constraints**:
- ✅ Can only create self-assessments during active evaluation periods
- ✅ Cannot create assessments after period deadline

---

### 4.2. Rating Validation

**Self-Rating Code Rules**:
- ✅ Rating code is **optional** in draft state
- ✅ Rating code is **required** for submission
- ✅ Database stores both:
  - `self_rating_code` (string): The letter grade (e.g., "A+")
  - `self_rating` (decimal): Numeric equivalent (e.g., 5.0) for calculations

**Rating Scale by Context**:

**Individual Assessment (Per Goal) - User Input**: **SS | S | A | B | C | D** (up to 6 levels)
- User selects one of these grades when evaluating each goal
- **Performance Goals (業績目標)**: All 6 grades (SS, S, A, B, C, D)
- **Competency Goals (コンピテンシー)**: All 6 grades (SS, S, A, B, C, D)
- **Quantitative Goals (定量目標)**: All 6 grades (SS, S, A, B, C, D)
- **Qualitative Goals (定性目標)**: Only 5 grades (SS, S, A, B, C) - NO D grade
- Grade-to-Number Mapping:
  ```
  SS → 7.0 | S → 6.0 | A → 4.0
  B → 2.0  | C → 1.0 | D → 0.0 (not available for 定性目標)
  ```

**Final Calculated Assessment - System Output**: **SS | S | A+ | A | A- | B | C | D** (8 levels)
- System calculates final grade based on weighted average of all goal assessments
- Includes intermediate grades A+, A- for more precise evaluation
- Used for overall period performance rating
- Grade-to-Number Mapping:
  ```
  SS → 7.0 | S → 6.0 | A+ → 5.0 | A → 4.0
  A- → 3.0 | B → 2.0 | C → 1.0  | D → 0.0
  ```

**Key Distinction**:
- **Input Scale (6 levels)**: What users select for each individual goal - SS, S, A, B, C, D
- **Output Scale (8 levels)**: What system calculates for final evaluation - SS, S, A+, A, A-, B, C, D

**Comment Rules**:
- ✅ **Employee self-assessment comment**: **REQUIRED** (mandatory for submission)
- ✅ **Supervisor comment**:
  - **Optional** when approving self-assessment
  - **REQUIRED** when rejecting self-assessment (must provide rejection reason)
- ⚠️ **Open Question**: Should there be a minimum/maximum character count?

---

### 4.3. Status Transitions

**Draft State**:
- ✅ Editable by employee
- ✅ Auto-saved periodically (frontend behavior)
- ✅ Can be deleted
- ✅ No `submitted_at` timestamp
- ✅ Rating and comment are optional

**Submitted State**:
- ✅ Must have `submitted_at` timestamp (database constraint)
- ✅ Must have `self_rating_code` (enforced at submission)
- ✅ Must have `self_comment` (enforced at submission)
- ✅ Awaiting supervisor feedback
- ✅ **Can be edited and resubmitted** by employee if supervisor has not yet reviewed (SupervisorFeedback.status = 'pending' or not created)
- 🔄 **If supervisor approves**: Status changes to 'approved' (immutable)
- 🔄 **If supervisor rejects**: Status changes to 'rejected' (see Rejection Flow in section 5.2)

**Approved State**:
- 🔒 **Read-only** (immutable, permanently locked)
- ✅ Supervisor approved this self-assessment
- ✅ Counts toward Core Value unlock requirement
- ✅ Final record of employee's self-evaluation
- ❌ Cannot be edited or deleted

**Rejected State**:
- 🔒 **Read-only** (immutable history record)
- ✅ Visible in rejection history
- ✅ Supervisor's rejection comment available via SupervisorFeedback
- ✅ System automatically creates **NEW self-assessment** in 'draft' status with `previous_self_assessment_id` pointing to this rejected record
- ❌ Cannot be edited or deleted

**Database Constraint**:
```sql
CHECK ((status NOT IN ('submitted', 'approved', 'rejected')) OR (submitted_at IS NOT NULL))
```

---

### 4.4. Permission Rules

**Employee Permissions**:
- ❌ **Cannot** manually create self-assessments (auto-created by system when goal approved)
- ✅ Can **read** their own self-assessments
- ✅ Can **update** their own self-assessments (only in draft state)
- ✅ Can **delete** their own self-assessments (only in draft state)
- ✅ Can **submit** their own self-assessments
- ❌ **Cannot** edit submitted/approved/rejected self-assessments
- ❌ **Cannot** view/edit other employees' self-assessments

**Supervisor Permissions**:
- ✅ Can **read** subordinates' self-assessments (all statuses)
- ❌ **Cannot** create/edit/delete subordinates' self-assessments
- ✅ Can **create** supervisor feedback on submitted self-assessments

**Admin Permissions**:
- ✅ Can **read** all self-assessments (organization-wide, read-only)
- ❌ **Cannot** create/edit/delete any self-assessments

---

### 4.5. Data Integrity Rules

**Unique Constraint**:
- ✅ One self-assessment per goal
- ✅ Database index: `idx_self_assessments_goal_unique` on `goal_id`
- ⚠️ **Important**: With rejection history pattern, multiple self-assessments can exist for the same goal (original rejected + new drafts), but only ONE active self-assessment per goal at a time. May need to adjust unique constraint logic to allow this pattern.

**Cascade Deletion**:
- ✅ If a goal is deleted → self-assessment is deleted (`ON DELETE CASCADE`)
- ✅ If an evaluation period is deleted → self-assessment is deleted (`ON DELETE CASCADE`)

**Referential Integrity**:
- ✅ `goal_id` must reference an existing goal
- ✅ `period_id` must reference an existing evaluation period
- ✅ `previous_self_assessment_id` (nullable) must reference an existing self-assessment (for rejection history chain)

---

### 4.6. Validation Summary Table

| Field | Required? | Constraints | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `goal_id` | ✅ Yes | Must be approved goal owned by user | See unique constraint note in 4.5 |
| `period_id` | ✅ Yes | Must be active period | - |
| `previous_self_assessment_id` | ❌ No | Must reference existing self-assessment if provided | For rejection history tracking |
| `self_rating_code` | Draft: ❌ No<br>Submit: ✅ Yes | SS\|S\|A+\|A\|A-\|B\|C\|D | Letter grade |
| `self_rating` | Auto-calculated | 0.0-7.0 (decimal) | Numeric equivalent for calculations |
| `self_comment` | Draft: ❌ No<br>Submit: ✅ Yes | String, non-empty | **REQUIRED for submission** |
| `status` | ✅ Yes | `draft`, `submitted`, `approved`, or `rejected` | Default: `draft` |
| `submitted_at` | Draft: ❌ No<br>Submit/Approved/Rejected: ✅ Yes | Auto-set on submission | Required for submitted, approved, and rejected states |

    end note
```

**State Transition Rules**:

| From State | To State | Trigger | Who | Conditions |
|------------|----------|---------|-----|------------|
| (none) | Draft | Create | **System** | Goal status changes to 'approved' → System auto-creates self-assessment in draft |
| Draft | Submitted | Submit | Employee | `self_rating_code` AND `self_comment` are provided |
| Draft | (deleted) | Delete | Employee | Still in draft state |
| Submitted | Draft | Edit | Employee | SupervisorFeedback not yet reviewed (status = 'pending' or not created) |
| Submitted | Rejected | Reject | System | SupervisorFeedback.status = 'rejected' → Self-assessment status changes to 'rejected', NEW draft created with `previous_self_assessment_id` |
| Submitted | Approved | Approve | System | SupervisorFeedback.status = 'approved' → **Self-assessment status changes to 'approved'** (immutable) |
| Rejected | (none) | - | - | **Immutable** - Read-only history record |
| Approved | (none) | - | - | **Immutable** - No reverse transition |

**Resubmission Rules**:
- ✅ Employee can edit and resubmit self-assessment **before** supervisor completes review
- 🔄 **If rejected**: Self-assessment status changes to 'rejected' (immutable). System creates **NEW draft** with `previous_self_assessment_id` pointing to rejected version
  - Employee can see supervisor's rejection comment from SupervisorFeedback (no need to view original self-assessment)
  - Employee revises NEW draft rating/comment based on supervisor feedback
  - Employee resubmits NEW draft for supervisor review again
  - Forms rejection history chain for audit trail
- ✅ Once supervisor **approves**, self-assessment status changes to 'approved' and becomes **permanently locked**
- ✅ **Notification**: Employee receives badge counter notification when supervisor rejects assessment (see Notification System in section 1)

### 5.2. SupervisorFeedback State Transitions

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2

    Pending --> Approved: Supervisor approves
    Pending --> Rejected: Supervisor rejects
    Approved --> [*]: Process complete
    Rejected --> [*]: Process complete

    note right of Approved
        ✅ Self-assessment status changes to 'approved'
        🔒 Self-assessment locked (immutable)
        ✅ Counts toward Core Value unlock
        🔓 Unlocks Core Value phase (if all approved)
    end note

    note right of Rejected
        🔄 Self-assessment status changed to 'rejected' (immutable)
        ✅ System creates NEW draft with previous_self_assessment_id
        ✅ Employee can see rejection reason via SupervisorFeedback
        ⚠️ Blocks Core Value phase
        ✏️ Employee revises NEW draft and resubmits
    end note
```

**SupervisorFeedback Transition Rules**:

| From State | To State | Trigger | Who | Conditions |
|------------|----------|---------|-----|------------|
| (none) | Pending | Create | Supervisor | Self-assessment is submitted |
| Pending | Approved | Approve | Supervisor | `supervisor_rating_code` is provided, `supervisor_comment` is **optional** |
| Pending | Rejected | Reject | Supervisor | `supervisor_comment` is **REQUIRED** (rejection reason mandatory) |
| Approved | (none) | - | - | **No reverse transition** |
| Rejected | (none) | - | - | **No reverse transition** |

**Supervisor Comment Rules**:
- ✅ **Approved**: Comment is optional (supervisor can provide feedback but not mandatory)
- ✅ **Rejected**: Comment is **REQUIRED** (must explain rejection reason to employee)

**Core Value Unlock Logic**:
- **Prerequisite**: Core Value goals are **only available in end-of-period evaluations (期末評価)**
  - Not available in mid-year reviews or interim evaluations
  - Period must be marked as `period_type = '期末'` or similar flag
- Core Value goals become available when **ALL** Performance + Competency self-assessments have `status = 'approved'`
- Query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM self_assessments WHERE status = 'approved' AND goal_category IN ('業績目標', 'コンピテンシー')`
- If ANY self-assessment is not approved (draft/submitted/rejected), Core Value phase remains locked until resolution

**Rejection Flow** (Following Goal Review Pattern):
- 🔄 When supervisor rejects (SupervisorFeedback.status = 'rejected'):
  1. **Original self-assessment status changes to 'rejected'** (immutable history record)
  2. **System creates NEW self-assessment in 'draft' status** with:
     - Same goal_id, period_id
     - Copy of self_rating_code, self_comment from rejected version
     - `previous_self_assessment_id` → points to rejected self-assessment (for history tracking)
  3. Employee sees supervisor's rejection comment from SupervisorFeedback (**no need to view original self-assessment**)
  4. Employee edits the NEW draft self-assessment
  5. Employee resubmits the NEW draft
  6. Supervisor reviews the NEW self-assessment
  7. Process repeats until approved

**History Tracking**:
- Each rejection creates a new self-assessment linked via `previous_self_assessment_id`
- Chain: Rejected SA1 (status='rejected') ← SA2 (draft → submitted → rejected) ← SA3 (draft → submitted → approved)
- Full rejection history visible by following `previous_self_assessment_id` chain
- Employee can query rejection history, but **supervisor's comment is sufficient** - no UI needed to view original rejected self-assessments

**Open Questions**:
- ⚠️ Can supervisor **change** approval after approving (Approved → Pending)?
- ⚠️ What happens if supervisor takes too long to review (timeout/auto-approve)?
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Rejection history is tracked via `previous_self_assessment_id` chain following goal-review pattern

---

## 5.3. Notification System Integration

### Badge Counter Implementation

**Frontend Context Architecture** (React Context API):

| Context | Purpose | Count Logic | API Endpoint |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| `SelfAssessmentReviewContext` | Supervisor notification | Count `self_assessments` where `status = 'submitted'` | `getSelfAssessmentsAction({ status: 'submitted' })` |
| `SelfAssessmentListContext` | Employee notification | Count `self_assessments` where `status = 'draft' AND previous_self_assessment_id IS NOT NULL` | `getSelfAssessmentsAction({ status: 'draft' })` + client filter |

**Provider Hierarchy**:
```
app/layout.tsx (Root Layout)
  └─ GoalReviewProvider (Global - existing)
     └─ SelfAssessmentReviewProvider (Global - to implement)
        └─ app/(evaluation)/layout.tsx (Evaluation Layout)
           └─ GoalListProvider (Scoped - existing)
              └─ SelfAssessmentListContext (Scoped - to implement)
                 └─ Sidebar + Pages
```

**Sidebar Display Logic** (`frontend/src/components/display/sidebar.tsx`):
```typescript
// Supervisor side - /evaluation-feedback
const { pendingSelfAssessmentsCount } = useSelfAssessmentReviewContext();
{pendingSelfAssessmentsCount > 0 && (
  <Badge variant="destructive">
    {pendingSelfAssessmentsCount > 99 ? '99+' : pendingSelfAssessmentsCount}
  </Badge>
)}

// Employee side - /evaluation-input
const { rejectedSelfAssessmentsCount } = useSelfAssessmentListContext();

```

**Cache Strategy**:
- **Cache Tag**: `CACHE_TAGS.SELF_ASSESSMENTS` (already exists)
- **Duration**: 5 minutes (DYNAMIC)
- **Revalidation**: Automatic on mutations via `revalidateTag('SELF_ASSESSMENTS')`
- **Manual Refresh**: Pages call `refreshPendingSelfAssessmentsCount()` on data changes

**Update Flow**:
1. **Employee submits self-assessment**:
   - Backend creates `self_assessment` with `status = 'submitted'`
   - Revalidates `SELF_ASSESSMENTS` cache tag
   - Supervisor's `SelfAssessmentReviewContext` refreshes count
   - Badge appears on `/evaluation-feedback` icon

2. **Supervisor rejects self-assessment**:
   - Backend creates `supervisor_feedback` with `status = 'rejected'`
   - Backend creates NEW `self_assessment` with `status = 'draft'` and `previous_self_assessment_id`
   - Revalidates `SELF_ASSESSMENTS` cache tag
   - Employee's `SelfAssessmentListContext` refreshes count
   - Badge appears on `/evaluation-input` icon

3. **Supervisor approves self-assessment**:
   - Backend updates `supervisor_feedback` to `status = 'approved'`
   - Revalidates `SELF_ASSESSMENTS` cache tag
   - Supervisor's count decrements (no longer `submitted`)
   - Badge counter updates or disappears

## 6. Open Questions

### 6.1. Submission Flow
- [x] ~~**Can employee cancel submission?**~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED**: Employee can resubmit before supervisor reviews
- [x] ~~**After rejection**~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED**: Original self-assessment stays 'submitted', system creates NEW draft with `previous_self_assessment_id` pointing to rejected version (following goal-review pattern)
- [x] ~~**Rejection history**~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED**: Full rejection history tracked via `previous_self_assessment_id` chain
- [ ] **Submission deadline**: What happens to draft assessments after period deadline?
  - Auto-submit with current data?
  - Mark as incomplete?
  - Prevent submission?
- [x] ~~**Rejection cycle limit**~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED**: No limit - process repeats until supervisor approves
- [ ] **UI for rejection history**: How should UI display the rejection history chain to employees and supervisors?

### 6.2. Comment Requirements
- [x] ~~**Employee comment required?**~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED**: REQUIRED for submission
- [x] ~~**Supervisor comment required?**~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED**: Optional for approval, REQUIRED for rejection
- [ ] **Minimum comment length?** (e.g., 10 characters for meaningful feedback)
- [ ] **Maximum comment length?** (e.g., 1000 characters to prevent essays)
- [ ] **Comment template or guidance?** Should UI provide prompts?

### 6.3. Notifications
- [x] ~~**Who gets notified when**~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED**: Badge counter notification system (following goal-review pattern):
  - **Employee submits self-assessment** → Badge counter appears on `/evaluation-feedback` icon in left navigation bar for supervisor (showing count of pending self-assessments)
  - **Supervisor rejects self-assessment** → Badge counter appears on `/evaluation-input` icon in left navigation bar for employee (showing count of rejected self-assessments to review)
  - Same logic already implemented for goal review
- [ ] **Notification channels**: Email notifications needed in addition to badge counters?

### 6.4. Supervisor Feedback Integration
- [ ] **Can supervisor see self-assessment before completing their own review?**
- [ ] **Are self-assessment and supervisor feedback shown side-by-side?**
- [ ] **Can supervisor override self-rating completely?**

### 6.5. Reporting and Analytics
- [ ] **Completion rate tracking**: How to measure % of goals with self-assessments?
- [ ] **Rating discrepancy analysis**: Should system flag large gaps between self-rating and supervisor rating?
- [ ] **Historical trends**: Can employees see their self-ratings over multiple periods?

### 6.6. Edge Cases
- [ ] **What if goal is edited after self-assessment is created?**
  - Invalidate self-assessment?
  - Keep old version?
- [ ] **What if goal is rejected after self-assessment submitted?**
  - Delete self-assessment?
  - Mark as orphaned?
- [ ] **Can employee create self-assessment before all goals are approved?**
  - For approved goals only (current behavior)
  - Wait until all goals approved

### 6.7. Multi-Language Support
- [ ] **Comment language**: Japanese only? Multi-language support needed?
- [ ] **UI localization**: Interface in Japanese? English? Both?

### 6.8. Core Value Sequential Flow
- [x] ~~**Period availability**~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED**: Core Value is **only available in end-of-period evaluations (期末評価)**, not in mid-year or interim reviews
- [x] ~~**Unlock trigger**~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED**: Core Value phase unlocks automatically when all Performance+Competency self-assessments are approved (only in 期末 periods)
- [ ] **Notification**: How is employee notified that Core Value goals are now available?
- [ ] **Partial approval**: What if only some Performance/Competency self-assessments are approved? Does employee wait for all?
- [ ] **Rejection handling**: If supervisor rejects a Performance self-assessment after Core Value is already completed, what happens?
  - Invalidate Core Value assessment?
  - Lock Core Value in current state?
  - Allow Core Value to remain valid?
- [ ] **Multiple Core Value goals**: Can employee have multiple Core Value goals, or just one?
- [x] ~~**Core Value approval**~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED**: Yes, Core Value self-assessment requires supervisor approval like Performance and Competency

## 7. Assumptions (to be validated)

Based on current code analysis:

1. ⚠️ **One ACTIVE self-assessment per goal** (unique constraint on `goal_id` may need adjustment - multiple can exist for rejection history)
2. ⚠️ **Four states for SelfAssessment**: draft, submitted, approved, and rejected (following goal-review pattern) - **Current code only has draft/submitted**
3. ✅ **SupervisorFeedback has three states**: pending, approved, rejected (approval/rejection state tracked separately)
4. ⚠️ **Resubmission allowed**: Employee can edit and resubmit before supervisor reviews - **Current code does NOT allow this**
5. ⚠️ **Rejection history pattern**: Following goal-review pattern where rejected self-assessment status changes to 'rejected' and system creates NEW draft with `previous_self_assessment_id` - **Current code does NOT implement this pattern**
6. ⚠️ **Rejection history field**: `previous_self_assessment_id` field needed for tracking rejection history chain - **Current database model does NOT have this field**
7. ✅ **Auto-save in frontend** (not enforced by backend)
8. ⚠️ **Employee comment REQUIRED**: Must provide comment on submission - **Current code makes it optional**
9. ⚠️ **Supervisor comment conditionally required**: Optional for approval, REQUIRED for rejection - **Current code does NOT enforce this**
10. ⚠️ **No explicit deadline enforcement** (evaluation period has deadline, but unclear if enforced for self-assessments)
11. ⚠️ **No character limits on comments** (unlimited currently)
12. ⚠️ **Grading system**: Letter grades (SS, S, A+, A, A-, B, C, D) with numeric equivalents (0.0-7.0) - **Current code uses 0-100 scale and needs migration**
13. ⚠️ **Sequential flow**: Core Value goals require ALL Performance + Competency self-assessments to be approved first - **Current code does not enforce this sequencing**
14. ✅ **Badge notification system**: Follows existing goal-review pattern with React Context API for badge counters in sidebar navigation - **Implementation documented in section 5.3**
15. ⚠️ **Badge counter contexts**: Need to implement `SelfAssessmentReviewContext` (supervisor) and `SelfAssessmentListContext` (employee) following existing `GoalReviewContext` and `GoalListContext` patterns - **Not yet implemented**
